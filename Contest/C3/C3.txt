Max Chunks To Make Sorted:
You are given an integer array "arr" of length "n", which represents a permutation of the integers in the range ( 0, n - 1). The task is to divide the array "arr" into some number of chunks (partitions) and sort each chunk individually. After sorting the chunks, print the chunk one by one.
Given 'arr' as [1, 0, 2, 3, 4], we can split it into four chunks: [1, 0], [2], [3], and [4]. Each chunk is sorted individually. So tottally four chunks are available print all chunks in the outputline.
Sample Example:
Input:
1 0 2 3 4
Output:
1 0
2
3
4
