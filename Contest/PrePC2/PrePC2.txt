Stock Combination Finder:
You are given a number of stocks, and the list of stocks, each with a name and price one by one, and a maximum budget for purchasing these stocks. Your goal is to find all valid combinations of stocks that can be bought within your budget to reach a specific target price. In the output, the quantity of each individual stock must not exceed a maximum of 5.

Write a program that takes the following inputs and provides the corresponding output:

Inputs:
Enter your maximum budget as an integer (numeric).
Specify the number of stocks you want to consider as an integer.
For each stock, provide its name (a string) and price (an integer) in same line.

Output:
Your program should generate and display all valid combinations of stocks that meet the target price criteria.
A valid combination is one where the total cost of the stocks matches the target price.
Display each valid combination as a list of quantities, where the quantities of each stock to buy.
Additionally, provide the total count of valid combinations found.

Note: Handle invalid inputs gracefully, such as non-numeric inputs, negative stock prices, or a budget that is not a positive number. For these cases, the output should be 'Invalid input', 'One of the stock prices is higher than the target price', and 'The stock prices should be at least above 0' respectively.

Example - 1

Input:
1000
4
Intel 110
REL 150
Infosys 720
Wipro 250

Output:
0 0 0 4
0 5 0 1
5 3 0 0
3

Explanation:
Let's assume Nifty 4 index. We are going to buy all the stocks for exactly 1000 rupees. So we can buy different kind of valid combinations those are listed and total possible combinations are 3.

Example - 2

Input:
2000
3
Infosys 50
Vedanta 150
TCS 300

Output:

1 3 5
1 5 4
4 2 5
4 4 4
4

Explanation:

Let's assume Nifty is trading based on 3 stocks. We are going to buy all the stocks for exactly 2000 rupees. So we can buy different kind of valid combinations those are listed and total possible combinations are 4.

Constraints:

user enters a stock price should be below 0. So it should print - The stock prices should be at least greater than 0
user should not enter a non-numeric value for the target price. So it should print - "Invalid Input"
user should not enter a non-numeric value for the Stock price. So it should print - "Invalid Input"
the price of the stocks should not higher than specified target price. So it should print - One of the stock price is higher than the target price.

Exercise - 1:

Input:
100
3
TATA_POWER 67
CANARA_BANK 56
HDFC_BANK -5

Output:

The stock prices should be at least greater than 0

Exercise - 2:

Input:
50
3
BAJAJ 10
HONDA 15
TVS 20

Output:
0 2 1
1 0 2
2 2 0
3 0 1
5 0 0
5

Note: Print the valid combinations in ascending order, where '0 2 1' is considered as 021, which is the smallest value, and '5 0 0' is considered as 500, which is the largest value.
