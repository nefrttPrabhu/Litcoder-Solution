Compute the diagonal difference
You are given a square matrix, and your task is to calculate the absolute difference between the sums of its diagonals.

Consider the following matrix:

2 4 6
8 5 3
1 9 7

To find the absolute difference between the sums of its diagonals, follow these steps:

Identify the two diagonals:
Left-to-right diagonal (LTR): 2, 5, 7
Right-to-left diagonal (RTL): 6, 5, 1

Calculate the sum of each diagonal:
LTR diagonal sum: 2 + 5 + 7 = 14
RTL diagonal sum: 6 + 5 + 1 = 12

Find the absolute difference between the diagonal sums:
Absolute difference = |14 - 12| = 2

Therefore, for the given matrix, the absolute difference between the sums of its diagonals is 2.

Your task is to write a program that takes a square matrix as input and outputs the absolute difference between the sums of its diagonals.
