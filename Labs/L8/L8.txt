You have been asked to assist in studying the distribution of plants in a particular region. Each type of plant is identified by a unique integer value. Whenever a botanist spots a plant, its ID number is added to an array of sightings. Your task is to determine which type of plant is the most common, considering the list of sightings. You should print the ID number of the most common plant. If multiple types of plants are equally common, choose the plant with the smallest ID number.
For example, assume the plant sightings are represented by the array sightings = [2, 3, 3, 1,1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4]. There are two plants with ID 1, three plants with ID 2, three plants with ID 3, and three plants with ID 4. Since the plant with ID 2 is the most common among them, you should print 2 as the answer.
