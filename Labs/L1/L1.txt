Zero Sum Subarray:
Given an array of positive and negative integers, write a program to determine if there exists a subarray with a sum equal to zero. If a subarray with a sum equal to zero is found, print "True," otherwise print "False."

First line output prints ‘True’ or ‘False’
Second line output print total number of the elements in array
Example with Explanations:

You have a one-line input
First line takes array elements

For example,

Input:
4 -2 3 1 6

Explanation:

Consider the array [4, -2, 3, 1, 6]. The program examines each element of the array, calculating the cumulative sum at each step. Initially, the cumulative sum is 4 (the first element). Moving to the second element, the cumulative sum becomes 2 after adding -2. As we progress through the array, updating the cumulative sum with each element, we find that at no point does the cumulative sum reach zero or repeat any previous value. This implies that there is no subarray with elements adding up to zero. Therefore, the program concludes that there is no subarray with a sum equal to zero and outputs is:

Output:
False
5

Constraints:

The size of the array (N) is between 1 and 10. If it does NOT meet this condition, print “Array size must be between 1 and 10”.
Each element in the array is between -10 and 10. If it does NOT meet this condition, print "Array elements must be from -10 to 10".
The array can contain only both positive and negative integers. If it does NOT meet this condition, print “Array elements must be integers”.
The elements of the array are integers.
Note: If the constraints are not satisfied the program should print specific message.

Conditions Need to Meet:

The program should print "True" if there is a subarray with a sum equal to zero, and "False" otherwise.
If the elements of the array are not integers, print a proper error message.
If array elements exceed the size of the array, print a proper error message.
