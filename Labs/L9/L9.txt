Compare the Triplets
Charlie and Dave each submitted a project for evaluation. A panel of judges rates the projects based on three criteria: innovation, execution, and impact, assigning scores from 1 to 10.
Charlie's project received scores represented by the triplet c = (c[0], c[1], c[2]),.....
while Dave's project was scored with the triplet d = (d[0], d[1], d[2])........
The task is to calculate the comparison points by comparing c[0] with d[0], c[1] with d[1], and c[2] with d[2].........
When c[i] is greater than d[i], Charlie earns 1 point, When c[i] is less than d[i], Dave earns 1 point and When c[i] is equal to d[i], neither person receives any points.
The comparison points represent the total points earned by each person.
Given the scores of Charlie's project (c) and Dave's project (d), determine their respective comparison points.
