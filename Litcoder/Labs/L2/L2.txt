Devices Count:-
A device manufacturer tests its devices through an operation that lasts approximately 4 hours for each device. Now, calculate the number of devices that can be tested in the given amount of time and display the remaining number of devices to be tested.
If the given time is less than the operation period of 4 print “Invalid Input”.

Example with Explanation:

Sample Example 1:

Input:
12
70

Output:
3
67

Explanation:
The input includes two lines:
The first line represents the availability of hours.
The second line represents the number of devices to be tested.
The output also includes two lines:
The first line indicates the number of devices tested in the given time.
With an available testing time of 12 hours and each device requiring 4 hours, we can test 3
devices in the given time ((12/4) = 3(if the value is decimal value need to take floor value.)).
The second line indicates the remaining devices to be tested out of the given 70 devices.
((70 – 3) = 67)

Sample Example 2:

Input:
3
10

Output:
Invalid Input

Explanation:
The input includes two lines:
The First line represents the number hours we have given to count the number of devices that
can tested in that certain hours.
The Second line represents maximum number of devices to test.
The output line represents “Invalid Input”.
Since, the Given hours is less than 4 the constraints did not satisfy.

Constraints:

Given Hours > 4.
If the constraints are not satisfied, print “Invalid Input”.
In the given time, if all the devices are tested,Print in the output first line, given devices count and Print in the output second line “0”.
